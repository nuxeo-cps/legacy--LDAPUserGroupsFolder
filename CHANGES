Requires:

New features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Added the fields "uid" and "mail" to the default LDAP schema, since everybody
  always needs it.
Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- Fixed manage_editUser that was not modifying mapped attributes. One effect of
  that bug what that it was impossible to modify the email address of a user
  since the CPSDirectory uses the "email" attribute and the LDAP inetOrgPerson
  objectclass uses the "mail" attribute.
New internal features:
