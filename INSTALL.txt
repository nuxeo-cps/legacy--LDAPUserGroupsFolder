Installing the LDAPUserFolder Product

    You will need Zope version 2.4.0 or higher (which necessitates
    Python version 2.0 or higher)!

    This product does not require any special handling after unzipping
    and untarring it in the Zope Products directory. You should do 
    something like::

        $ cp LDAPUserFolder-xyz.tgz <zope_root>/lib/python/Products
        $ cd <zope_root>/lib/python/Products
        $ tar zxvf LDAPUserFolder-xyz.tgz
        <watch files being decompressed>

    Windows users can use WinZip or similar, it can handle tarred 
    gzip files. Make sure to move the extracted LDAPUserFolder 
    folder to your Zope installation's lib/python/Products-folder.

    That's all. Do not forget to restart Zope afterwards.


    **Upgraders beware**

    In order to avoid problems everyone who upgrades from a prior 
    version of the LDAPUserFolder should delete and recreate any
    LDAPUserFolder instance they have!

    
    **Important Hints**

    Depending on your choice of Zope install (e.g. compiled from source
    or binary version) you need to make sure that the python-ldap 
    module (see README.txt) can be found by Zope.

    The first step after compiling the python-ldap module is to find 
    out if it works correctly by firing up your python interpreter 
    and typing "import _ldap". Then hit return. If no error message shows 
    up the module is compiled and installed correctly.

    If after correctly installing and compiling the python-ldap 
    module Zope still complains "ImportError: No module named ldap"
    you need to find the module file (its name is "ldapmodule.so") and 
    manually copy it into the LDAPUserFolder folder in your Zope 
    Products folder. This will be the case with all those Zope installs 
    that contain their own python binary, like the Linux binary install.

    If you for some reason decide to run Zope on a certain OS from Redmond
    you might have difficulties getting python-ldap in a precompiled 
    version. Barry Pederson found the following website which might help:
    http://www.it.uq.edu.au/personal/leonard/dc-prj/ldapmodule/
    Barry also put all needed components (a LDAP DLL from the University
    of Michigan LDAP distribution and precompiled python-ldap modules) up
    in his member area on zope.org at:
    
    http://www.zope.org/Members/barryp/win32_ldap

    This module can be copied into the LDAPUserFolder folder on the file 
    system.

    If you run the LDAP server on the same machine as your Zope instance and 
    use python-ldap 2.0.0pre1-2.0.0pre4 you might experience severe slowdowns
    due to a bug in those python-ldap versions. See this URL for more info::

    See README.txt for any other dependencies and requirements.
