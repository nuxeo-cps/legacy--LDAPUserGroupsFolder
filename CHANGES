Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- Correctly work with groups stored in the ZODB.
- getUserNames now applies an objecClass filter to only return users.
- If a user doesn't have a role or group and should be deleted from local roles or groups, it is checked that the user exists before tryng to delete.
- When a role is created, it's now added to the portal as well.
- Some user folder methods used by CPSDirectory was not implemented or had
  non-standard names. This is now fixed.
New internal features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- In some cases correctly normalize DNs that contain spaces.
- Implemented mergedLocalRolesWithPath and removed optional argument
  withpath from mergedLocalRoles
- _doAddUser implemented.
