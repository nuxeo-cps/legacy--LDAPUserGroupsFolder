    2.3beta2

      Bugs fixed:

        * Cut down on the number of LDAP lookups in cases where the
          user lookup happens "anonymously", meaning not as part of a 
          normal authenticated request but from the Zope security
          machinery for things like ownership-related security checks.
          Thanks to Kyler Laird for bringing this one up.

      Features added:

        * All user lookups are now limited to those object classed 
          defined in the "User object classes" configuration setting
          on the "Configure" tab. Previously the lookup policy was
          much more lenient and accepted every record where the login
          matched - now the object classes have to match as well.

          ***WARNING - THIS MIGHT BREAK YOUR SITE IF YOU WERE SLOPPY
          WITH THE OBJECT CLASSES SETTING AND USAGE!***

          Due to the possible breakage I had been sitting on Tracker
          issue 294, filed by Andy Dustman, for quite a while before
          going with it. Thanks for keeping te pressure on - it is 
          "the right thing" to do.

       * The "Users" tab will now show a little more information on
         the user record detail view by default, namely the DN and
         the object classes.

       * The unit tests have been changed to work with the latest
         and greatest (Zope 2.7 and Python 2.3.2), which is now the
         default platform used to test and develop this product.
  

    2.3beta1

      Bugs fixed:

        * Use of the distinguished name as login attribute was broken
          in version 2.2 - thanks to Ralf Herold for the information
          (JTracker issue 312)

        * The API documentation for manage_addUser in the Zope Help
          System was slightly off, thanks go to Eugene Prigorodov for
          pointing that out (Issue 319).

        * Cleaned up LDAP filter strings used by the product to have
          surrounding parentheses.

        * Enable correct handling of DN elements that contain bad
          characters, such as backslash-escaped commas (Bug report 
          by Stephen Kirby)
